# EC-Net: an Edge-aware Point set Consolidation Network
by [Lequan Yu](https://yulequan.github.io/), Xianzhi Li, [Chi-Wing Fu](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwfu/), [Daniel Cohen-Or](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/), [Pheng-Ann Heng](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng/). Details are in [project page](https://yulequan.github.io/ec-net).

### Introduction

This repository is for our ECCV 2018 paper '[EC-Net: an Edge-aware Point set Consolidation Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06010)'. This project is based on our previous project [PU-Net](https://github.com/yulequan/PU-Net). 

### Installation
This repository is based on Tensorflow and the TF operators from PointNet++. Therefore, you need to install tensorflow and compile the TF operators. 

For installing tensorflow, please follow the official instructions in [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux). The code is tested under TF1.3 (higher version should also work) and Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 16.04.

For compiling TF operators, please check `tf_xxx_compile.sh` under each op subfolder in `code/tf_ops` folder. Note that you need to update `nvcc`, `python` and `tensoflow include library` if necessary. You also need to remove `-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` flag in g++ command in order to compile correctly if necessary.

To compile the operators in TF version >=1.4, you need to modify the compile scripts slightly.

First, find Tensorflow include and library paths.

        TF_INC=$(python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.sysconfig.get_include())')
        TF_LIB=$(python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.sysconfig.get_lib())')
        
Then, add flags of `-I$TF_INC/external/nsync/public -L$TF_LIB -ltensorflow_framework` to the `g++` commands.

We adopt the Dijkstra algorithm implemented in python-graph library, you can follow the instruction in [here](https://github.com/wting/python-graph) to install it. 

(EDIT: or you could use [my fork](https://github.com/prashantraina/python-graph) instead. Go to the `code` directory and run `python setup.py install` and it should work)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yulequan/EC-Net.git
   cd EC-Net
   ```
2. Compile the TF operators:

   Follow the above information to compile the TF operators. 
   
3. Train the model:
 
   ```shell
   cd code
   python main.py --phase train --gpu 0 --log_dir ../model/myownmodel
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:

   We provide the pretrained model in folder `model/pretrain`.
   To evaluate the model, you need to put the test point clouds (in .xyz format) in the folder `eval_input`.
   
   Then run:
   ```shell
   cd code
   python main.py --phase test --log_dir ../model/pretrain
   ```
   You will see the input point cloud, output point cloud, and the identified edge points in the folder `eval_result`.
